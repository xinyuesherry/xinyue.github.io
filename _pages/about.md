I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) at [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/).  I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Zhi-Li Zhang](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~zhang089/). Before starting my Ph.D. study, I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Communication Engineering at University of Electronic Science & Technology of China.

I am interested in machine learning, deep learning, and their applications to computer communication and networks. I aim to design domain-knowledge-guided machine learning to intelligently model and enhance networked systems, such as smart grids, content delivery networks, 5G networks, and video streaming.

<span style="color: red;">I am actively looking for a full-time position. Feel free to let me know if you have any openings.</span>
